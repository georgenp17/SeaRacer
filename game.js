const gameConfig = {
    type: Phaser.AUTO,
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    physics: {
        default: 'arcade',
        arcade: {
            gravity: { y: 0 },
            debug: false
        }
    },
    scene: {
        preload: preload,
        create: create,
        update: update
    }
};

const game = new Phaser.Game(gameConfig);

function preload() {
    // Load your assets here
    // this.load.image('background', 'path_to_background_image.png');
    // this.load.image('swimmer', 'path_to_swimmer_sprite.png');
    // Continue for other assets...
}

function create() {
    // Example: Create background and swimmer
    // this.add.image(400, 300, 'background');
    // this.swimmer = this.physics.add.sprite(100, 300, 'swimmer');
}

function update() {
    // Update game logic here
}
For the sake of brevity, I've created a simple structure. To complete the game:

Populate the preload() function with links to your images and audio assets.
Expand the create() function to set up your game entities (player, obstacles, rings, upgrades).
Use the update() function to handle real-time game logic such as player movement, collision detection, and game progression.
3. Hosting with GitHub:
Create a new repository on GitHub.
Add your game files to this repository, including the HTML, JS, and all assets.
Ensure your repo is public, then go to the 'Settings' tab, scroll down to the 'GitHub Pages' section, select the branch you want to deploy (usually main or master), and save.
Once deployed, GitHub will provide you with a link. This will be your game's live URL.
To fully develop SeaRacer, you'd expand upon the provided structure, adding in the functionalities discussed in our design, breaking them down piece by piece and testing each part as you implement it.
